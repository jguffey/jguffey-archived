		<p class="exerpt">Always learning, that's my motto. When I'm not busy working, I'm usually hunched over a computer, book, or coffee table.</p>
		<p>I'm interested in things like architecture, graphic design, fashion, ...coffee, but I know what I'm most comfortable doing. I love building things. I like designing systems, from planning to implementation, I like to set a solid foundation for a successful product or team. My favorite part of a new project is that first line of JavaScript, or cloning a fresh copy of a framework, that first syncdb.</p>
